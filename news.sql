(1, 'The nurses risking it all on the frontline of Britain`s coronavirus outbreak', 'London (CNN) It gets really, really hot inside the protective gear Sean White has to wear most of the time. His skin is sore from the tight-fitting face mask and two pairs of gloves worn almost non-stop for 12 hours at a time.<br /><br />White is a critical care nurse at a major teaching hospital in London and -- like nurses in almost every country around the world -- he couldn`t be any more frontline in the battle against coronavirus. His hospital is currently treating several hundred Covid-19 patients in the city at the epicenter of the UK outbreak, which has so far claimed more than 7,000 lives.<br /><br />When coronavirus patients end up in hospital, it`s nurses who care for them most of the time and who are responsible for making sure they receive the right treatment.<br /><br />\"There is still this view that nurses, you know, are washing patients, feeding them and just being these compassionate, caring souls... which is exactly what nurses are, but there is this other layer of things that nurses do now,\" said Laura Duffell, a matron nurse at the King`s College Hospital in London.<br /><br />White spends his working days taking care of people who are fighting for their lives. Patients are often on ventilators, suffering from multiple organ failure, sedated, with number of tubes attached to them. It`s a high-pressure job, but he knows what he is doing -- he has been doing it for years.<br /><br />But in this crisis, White says even he is at his limits.<br /><br />\"We`re having to prioritize things, not do some of the other things that we normally do, we make changes to our normal practice,\" he said.<br /><br />White checks patients` oxygen levels, adjusts ventilators, runs blood tests, cleans wounds, replaces dressings, monitors tubes and takes care of sick people`s mouths and eyes. Once every four hours, he moves them to prevent bed sores. He also reassures them when they wake up in a scary and unfamiliar environment.<br /><br />At normal times, each nurse looks after one patient at a time. But these are not normal times. White has been deployed to other intensive care units (ICUs) and is now regularly juggling two patients. The plan is to go up to four if necessary, he says.<br /><br />\"These are demanding patients,\" said Rosana Josep Zaragoza, a nurse working at Guy`s Hospital in London, of ICU coronavirus cases. \"They might have eight infusions attached to their bed and you have to make sure they are not running out, that they are working properly, and you are dealing with a breathing machine and sometimes a kidney machine,\" she added.<br /><br />At the same time, the nurses are very aware of the risk they themselves are facing. White said that he and his colleagues are wondering \"when, rather than if\" they catch the virus. \"We`re hoping that it will be like a cold, but we keep hearing all the time of people who don`t necessarily have health problems who have died,\" he said.<br /><br />From left to right: Sean White, Rosana Josep Zaragoza and Laura Duffell are among the nurses on the frontline of this crisis.<br /><br />Nursing exodus<br /><br />The coronavirus crisis has hit the UK at the time when its public health system, the National Health Service, was already highly stretched because of the country`s aging population and the spending cuts that followed the 2008 financial crisis.<br /><br />Before the outbreak, a combination of tough conditions and low pay was leading to many nurses leaving the profession, according to the Royal College of Nursing (RCN). There are over 40,000 nurse vacancies across the UK, 10,000 of which are in London, says the RCN. At the same time, fewer young people are joining the pipeline because of cuts to training funding, it adds.<br /><br />In the UK, nurses` pre-tax salaries start just below £25,000 ($30,000) a year. That`s £5,000 below the country`s median salary. With more experience, pay for most can rise to around £37,000 ($45,535) a year, depending on seniority. The RCN said most nurses` paychecks falls into that region. Nurses with advanced training -- such as a master`s degree -- can make up to £44,503. Only matrons, chief nurses and specialized consultant nurses earn more than that.<br /><br />For comparison, doctors start at £28,200 to £32,691 during the first two years after medical school, when they are still training. After that, their basic salary rises to £38,693 to £49,036 during specialist training. Once fully qualified and with years of experience, doctors in the public system can earn as much as £107,000.<br /><br />White has been a frontline healthcare worker for a decade, and spent a big chunk of this time in critical care. He is planning to leave nursing after the coronavirus crisis has passed and work on building up his own business in medical aesthetics. While he will continue to work shifts in critical care to maintain his skills and fill in where the need is, his main focus will be elsewhere. A better work-life balance and the desire to do new things are among the reasons for his move, but money is also a factor.<br /><br />Even though nurses based in London get extra cash to cover the city`s higher cost of living, most end up living on very tight budgets. According to a RNC survey published in January, 26\\% of nurses in London said they were financially struggling and further 42\\% said they were just about able to meet essential living costs, but wouldn`t be able to cope with any unexpected costs.<br /><br />Long-term staff shortages are making the current crisis worse. There also aren`t currently enough coronavirus tests for healthcare workers in the UK. This means that any time a hospital employee or a member of their household shows symptoms, they have to self-isolate and stop work -- even if they don`t actually have the disease. The government has been trying to ramp up testing and as of Wednesday, 20,000 UK health workers and their family members have been tested, the Prime Minister`s spokesman said.<br /><br />Duffell said the high cost of living in places like London forces people to live with roommates, further exacerbating the situation.<br /><br />\"Many nurses will live with other healthcare professionals, partly because of the shift patterns and the understanding ... and then ... it means that if someone is then symptomatic, the whole household have to isolate, which means we have four [or] five nurses who are all off at the same time,\" Duffell said.<br /><br />`It`s a hideous situation`<br /><br />The coronavirus pandemic also means many nurses are being redeployed to departments they don`t normally work in, including intensive and critical care.<br /><br />Josep Zaragoza, the Guy`s Hospital nurse, has found herself exactly in that position. She expects to start working in ICUs this week. And while she has worked there in the past, she hasn`t done so in four years.<br /><br />\"I am scared,\" she said. \"I have been doing something completely different now, and obviously, ICU ... it`s a really specialized area and the patients are very sick, so you have to know what you`re doing, the pressures are enormous,\" she said.<br /><br />Josep Zaragoza said her hospital has been providing nurses like her with refresher training and simulation days. She said she will likely get to spend two days at the ICU observing and working alongside other nurses before starting to take care of patients on her own.<br /><br />\"I think it should be at least a week ... but I understand that they need nurses up and running as soon as possible,\" she added.<br /><br />Josep Zaragoza can rely on past experience, but many of her colleagues are being redeployed into jobs that are completely new to them. \"I can`t imagine how nervous people are going into such a specialized area which they have never worked in,\" she said. A spokesperson from Guy`s and St Thomas` NHS Foundation Trust said the hospital has asked \"all clinical teams to be prepared for the potential redeployment,\" adding that temporarily redeployed staff \"will receive appropriate training and support if necessary.\"<br /><br />Other major hospital are experiencing the same problems. A spokeswoman for Barts Health NHS Trust, the body that oversees the Royal London Hospital, said the hospital was \"working hard to while ensuring the safety of patients, staff and visitors.\" The spokeswomen referred to the hospital`s peak operating plan, which says that \"large number of staff\" will be retrained and redeployed.<br /><br />Duffell manages a team of around 50 to 60 nurses and healthcare assistants across several children`s wards. Some of them are now being reassigned to positions in critical care, despite not having the training that is normally required for these roles. In a statement on the King`s hospital website, Sarah Dheansa, the acting head of nursing for neurosciences and a member of the hospital`s Covid-19 response team, described the situation as challenging, but added the hospital had good processes in place.<br /><br />Duffell added: \"You`ve got a junior nurse in a flood of tears because she feels like she`s putting people at risk and you have to have that conversation that actually, you`re doing your absolute best, you rely on your knowledge and you know what you`re doing.<br /><br />\"It`s a hideous situation and unfortunately, I think there are going to be a huge number of nurses that are going to be quite traumatized.\"<br /><br />This story has been updated to correct the name of the hospital where Laura Duffell works.', 'Ivana Kottasová', 'cnn'),
(2, 'Some anti-vaxxers are changing their minds because of the coronavirus pandemic', 'Scientists are racing to produce a coronavirus inoculation on an unprecedented timescale , and some political leaders have warned that the restrictions on our lives may not be completely lifted until one is available.<br /><br />That`s something of a challenge to the anti-vaccine movement, many of whose members are strongly opposed to mandatory vaccines<br /><br />But the virus has also done something more startling. It has made some anti-vaxxers change their minds.<br /><br />Haley Searcy, 26, from Florida, told CNN she was \"fully anti-vax\" when her daughter was born in 2019.<br /><br />\"I had seen so many accounts of kids dying from SIDS [Sudden Infant Death Syndrome] and having other dangerous reactions due to vaccines,\" she said, repeating the scientifically unsupported but common fear amongst vaccine skeptics that even those treatments that have undergone rigorous testing might still be dangerous.<br /><br />\"I was just as scared of vaccines as I was of the diseases they protect against.\"<br /><br />Searcy said that after being advised by her daughter`s pediatrician, she \"begrudgingly allowed her to be vaccinated,\" but still suspected that vaccines were unnecessary and dangerous. The coronavirus outbreak has changed her view. \"Since Covid-19, I`ve seen firsthand what these diseases can do when they`re not being fought with vaccines,\" said Searcy.<br /><br />\"My mother has a lung disease, so if she gets Covid-19 there is no fighting it. I learned as much as I could to speak out against misinformation in the hopes that I could convince more people to stay home and follow social distancing so that she won`t get sick.\"<br /><br />\"So many lives are at stake, including people I care about who are very vulnerable.\"<br /><br />In the process of researching how the world had dealt with pandemics in the past, Searcy learned about how recent pandemics like swine flu were fought with vaccines. \"And I`ve learned just how rigorous vaccine trials are before they`re made available to the public,\" she said.<br /><br />She also looked up information about countries that had minimized the spread of the coronavirus.<br /><br />\"I wasn`t actively looking for vaccine information but the more I learned, the more I realized it would help and the easier it became to recognize the lack of science in anti-vax arguments,\" she said.<br /><br />In a number of countries, including the UK and France, concerns expressed by some people in recent years about vaccines in general have softened , according to polling carried out for the Vaccine Confidence Project, a research group at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.<br /><br />VCP Director Heidi Larson said the figures showed that, as the number of deaths from the coronavirus increased, and public awareness of its seriousness grew, people were more willing to accept a vaccine. \"I think it definitely is provoking people to rethink a lot of things,\" she said, but she cautioned that more data was needed to track reaction over time.<br /><br />She said some were \"going to the opposite side\" and were mistrustful of a potential Covid-19 vaccine.<br /><br />\"This is an important time to reflect on the value of vaccines,\" said Larson. \"If we had had a vaccine for this, we wouldn`t be locked up in a room, the economies wouldn`t be crumbling, we would have been a whole different world. The question I would ask is, do we have to wait for something to be this bad?\"<br /><br />When vaccines become widespread and people don`t see a threat, they grow more skeptical, Larson said. But she added that protecting society \"totally depends on public cooperation.\"<br /><br />A worrying trend<br /><br />Most children today receive life-saving vaccines, but health services have noticed a worrying pattern of declining uptake in recent years.<br /><br />In the UK, just 33 of 149 local authorities met their 95\\% vaccination target for diseases preventable by immunization in 2018-2019, according to National Health Service figures.<br /><br />Last year the United States experienced its greatest number of measles cases since 1992, mostly among people who were not vaccinated. In 2019 the UK lost its measles-free status, a designation conferred by the World Health Organization.<br /><br />And as Covid-19 surges, a UNICEF report warned that more than 117 million children are at risk of missing out on life-saving measles vaccinations. UNICEF urged countries to continue essential immunization, but said postponement could happen where the risk is \"unacceptably high.\"<br /><br />The term anti-vax \"has not been helpful,\" according to Larson. She said while there are some committed activists, \"there are a lot of other people out there who are on the fence, hesitant or questioning.\"<br /><br />Isaac Lindenberger, from Ohio, knows all about this. His mother is strongly against vaccination, and his younger brother Ethan hit the headlines last year when he decided to get vaccinated against her wishes at the age of 19. Lindenberger, 23, said he hadn`t thought much about vaccinations until then, but he did his research and was vaccinated six months ago as a condition of his entry to Ohio State University.<br /><br />He remains on good terms with his mother. He hosts a podcast called The Lucid Truth, and his goal is to address misinformation in the community with empathy. \"I definitely see the positive effect in anti-vaxxers that previously would not have considered vaccination,\" he told CNN. \"It`s way harder to be in a state of denial when it comes to the objective truth of the dangers of these infectious diseases when you`re experiencing a pandemic.\"<br /><br />He said that those who claim measles are harmless because we have few fatalities in the western world because of vaccinations were finding it much harder to do the same with coronavirus.<br /><br />\"Anti-vaxxers are still here. But they`re not showing themselves because during a pandemic of an infectious disease, it`s probably the wrong time to try to call out preventative measures,\" Lindenberger said. \"They`re kind of in their echo chambers.\"<br /><br />Those that object to vaccines publicly now risk fierce criticism. On Sunday, tennis player Novak Djokovic raised eyebrows after he voiced his views on a coronavirus vaccine while discussing the impact of the pandemic.<br /><br />\"Personally I am opposed to vaccination and I wouldn`t want to be forced by someone to take a vaccine in order to be able to travel,\" Djokovic said in a Facebook live chat. \"But if it becomes compulsory, what will happen? I will have to make a decision. I have my own thoughts about the matter and whether those thoughts will change at some point, I don`t know.\"<br /><br />Some people in anti-vax groups fear that governments will use lockdowns as an opportunity to push through legislation such as enforcing mandatory vaccines<br /><br />This is a serious concern for Lynette Marie Barron, who runs a group called Tough Love, and has twice successfully campaigned against bills to remove religious exemptions for vaccines in her state of Alabama.<br /><br />Barron has children with health problems. One of her daughters was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease which, Barron says, came after she was given her childhood vaccinations. Another daughter was born with severe autism, which Barron attributes to a tetanus vaccine she received after cutting a finger during pregnancy.<br /><br />The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that studies continue to show no link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder<br /><br />Even in the face of of apparently incontrovertible evidence of frontline health workers around the world, Barron believes authorities are \"fearmongering\" about the severity of the coronavirus in order to take away people`s rights.<br /><br />\"I think there`s a much bigger agenda here,\" she said. \"We were getting out, we were being loud. And now you can`t go anywhere and you can`t do anything.\"<br /><br />Barron said that the response in her community had been \"like a 50/50, which I wasn`t expecting,\" with some saying they were \"so scared\" of the virus that they would get a vaccine if it were available, while others were \"like me and say, I don`t care, I wouldn`t if you paid me a million dollars.\"<br /><br />Barron said the coronavirus was even persuading some people of the merits of vaccine skepticism. \"People are tired of this and they`re not going to sit at home much longer,\" she said. \"We`re all losing our livelihoods.\"<br /><br />JUST WATCHED How vaccines stop diseases like measles Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH How vaccines stop diseases like measles 01:26<br /><br />People were \"pretty freaked out\" about the speed of vaccine development, she said. Some pharmaceutical companies are already testing on humans, and some are forecasting that a vaccine could be ready within a year. \"Them rushing this like they are... they have no idea what the effects of this are going to be,\" she said.<br /><br />Paul Offit, a US pediatrician specializing in infectious diseases, regularly engages with Barron`s community in an effort to explain the science on vaccination.<br /><br />He told CNN that he understands the concerns about a rushed vaccine and that \"you could reasonably worry when things are made very quickly and under stress.\" But he added: \"We always care about vaccine safety. Everybody cares about vaccine safety, including pharmaceutical companies and the government and the medical community.\"<br /><br />Offit said anti-vaxxers were \"conspiracy theorists\" who \"don`t trust anyone\" but if the virus remains a serious threat then \"there`s only one way to provide herd immunity to this virus and that`s by vaccination.\"<br /><br />He said anti-vaxxers often told him they just wanted a choice in whether their family was vaccinated or not, but since vaccines are not 100\\% effective and some cannot be vaccinated because of other health issues, those who can be vaccinated had a responsibility to protect the community.<br /><br />\"Is it your inalienable right, as a US citizen or as a citizen of any country, to either to allow yourself or your child to be infected with a disease that`s potentially fatal, and it`s transmissive?\"<br /><br />\"I think the answer to that question is no.\"', 'Emma Reynolds', 'cnn'),

(4, 'The Mafia is poised to exploit coronavirus, and not just in Italy', '(CNN) Earlier this month, there was a funeral procession in the Sicilian town of Messina, in defiance of a nationwide lockdown in Italy .<br /><br />It was no ordinary procession. The couple of dozen people walking behind the hearse were paying their respects to a 70-year-old scion of one of the most notorious Mafia famiglie.<br /><br />Claudio Fava, president of the regional anti-Mafia committee, described it as a \"real scandal, an insult to those who lost their relatives in the pandemic.\"<br /><br />Funerals have been banned in Italy since early March as part of a broader set of restrictions aimed at curbing the Covid-19 outbreak that has killed nearly 23,000 people as of Friday.<br /><br />That the procession took place at all speaks to the power -- and the impunity -- wielded by the Mafia in parts of Italy.<br /><br />Senior anti-mafia officials and researchers have told CNN that Mafia clans are already taking advantage of the coronavirus pandemic, especially in southern Italy.<br /><br />They are providing everyday necessities in poor neighborhoods, offering credit to businesses on the verge of bankruptcy and planning to siphon off a chunk of the billions of euros being lined up in stimulus funds.<br /><br />The most powerful branch of the Mafia -- the `Ndrangheta, based in Calabria -- is thought to control 80\\% of the European cocaine market . Even as the pandemic made distribution more difficult, it took advantage of the lockdown.<br /><br />Journalist Roberto Saviano -- author of \"Gomorrah: Italy`s other Mafia,\" an expose of the Camorra mafia in Naples -- told CNN that \"the traffickers took advantage of the [lack of] oversight of law enforcement in the ports, in the airports.\"<br /><br />\"Who was checking any more?\" he asked.<br /><br />A police car patrols an empty street in Taormina this month after restrictions were imposed to avoid the spread of Covid-19.<br /><br />Exploiting a desperate need for cash<br /><br />But Mafia groups are about far more than trafficking cocaine. They are deeply embedded in the economy.<br /><br />While traditional Mafia activities such as extortion may suffer during the pandemic, there will also be fresh opportunities, said Anna Sergi, senior lecturer in criminology at the University of Essex.<br /><br />Franco Gabrielli, head of the Italian police, said that Mafia organizations are already deeply enmeshed in parts of the economy \"that have not been blocked by the restrictions of Covid-19: the agriculture-food chain, the supply of medicines and medical equipment, road transport.\"<br /><br />It`s a view shared by Saviano.<br /><br />\"Funeral homes they invest in, hospital laundries. Cleaning companies they`ve always invested in. Good delivery companies, gas stations, this is the portfolio they`ve had for the past 10 years,\" he told CNN.<br /><br />Such is the financial muscle of the `Ndrangheta, Gabrielli said last week, that it could exploit a desperate need for cash faced by businesses it doesn`t currently control.<br /><br />\"At the end of the emergency, the criminal associations could have polluted the economy, controlling companies previously not infiltrated,\" he said.<br /><br />Sergi says past crises have shown that the Mafia can move money quickly outside the banking system and demand fewer guarantees than banks. Lending money to distressed companies and then gradually taking control of them is a well-oiled mafia tactic.<br /><br />Nicola Gratteri, an anti-Mafia investigator and head of the public prosecutor`s office in Catanzaro, told CNN that businesses like restaurants and hotels are especially vulnerable.<br /><br />The last great recession, in 2008, offers a sobering comparison.<br /><br />Anti-Mafia groups like SOS Impresa said that crisis turned the Mafia into Italy`s largest bank. The Palermo-based group estimated in 2012 that the Mafia had 65 billion euros ($72 billion) in liquidity and described extortionate lending as \"a national emergency.\" At the same time, many Italian banks were struggling to stay afloat and borrowing heavily from the European Central Bank.<br /><br />Saviano believes liquidity will be \"the center of everything\" in the aftermath of the coronavirus crisis.<br /><br />\"The organization will come to a company in crisis and say: `We don`t buy everything, but we will give you cash in exchange for shares -- to become part of your company,`\" he said.<br /><br />\"This is what they will do with everyone.\"<br /><br />A parallel state<br /><br />At the end of last month, video footage of a couple hammering at the doors of a bank in the southern city of Bari went viral. \"You suck, the state sucks. How are we going to manage?\" the woman shouts.<br /><br />These are exactly the sort of circumstances the Mafia exploits. The `Ndrangheta and other clans don`t simply live off societies where they are strong. They build loyalty by supplying necessities to poorer neighborhoods and cash to struggling businesses.<br /><br />To Gratteri, this is \"a method to create allegiance. If we -- the state -- don`t show ourselves to be efficient, what could happen is that the Mafia presents itself as a winning a model, and maybe asks for a return favor at the elections.\"<br /><br />Zora Hauser, a researcher into organized crime at Oxford University, said that \"what we are seeing -- and will see more and more as the economic and social crisis unfolds -- is Mafia groups returning to their core businesses of protection and governance.\"<br /><br />Salvo Palazzolo, a journalist with La Repubblica newspaper, received threats after reporting on food handouts by someone with Mafia connections in the poor \"ZEN\" district of Palermo in Sicily.<br /><br />\"At this moment, Mafia families of Palermo [the Cosa Nostra] are very strong, especially in drugs and online gambling. They have a lot of liquidity,\" Palazzolo told CNN.<br /><br />\"I would say the Cosa Nostra are strengthening their control through welfare assistance to families who are in jail, and now this is spreading to all poor families. They want to show themselves as an alternative to the state.\"<br /><br />In another district of Palermo, a local Mafia boss tried to organize a Good Friday church service in defiance of the lockdown before police intervened.<br /><br />Criminologist Anna Sergi says the Mafia want the community both to like and need them.<br /><br />The government is aware of the danger. CNN obtained a letter written by Interior Minister Luciana Lamorgese to regional leaders warning that criminal organizations would try to use \"forms of support\" to gain popularity.<br /><br />As Zora Hauser puts it: \"This can be cashed by the organization in different ways, the most worrying one being votes.\"<br /><br />The government has established a 400 million-euro ($435 million) food voucher fund and allotted another 4.3 billion euros ($4.8 billion) to local mayors.<br /><br />As Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte promised on March 28: \"We know that many suffer, but the state is there.\"<br /><br />But it`s a daunting challenge. Saviano says that during this crisis, the mafia will try to hire the \"new unemployed\" as its foot soldiers. As many as three million Italians work \"off the books,\" according to multiple surveys. One survey by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in 2017 estimated that a quarter of Italians in their early 20s were neither in employment, nor in education or training.<br /><br />Stimulus bonanza<br /><br />Getting Italy back to work is the government`s priority. It`s injecting 750 billion euros ($815 billion) into the economy.<br /><br />Part of the investment is to guarantee loans to businesses -- covering more than three-quarters of a large company`s borrowing. But given the massive sums being dispersed, anti-Mafia investigators worry that some of those loans, as well as other support, will go to Mafia-run businesses.<br /><br />Italy also wants Europe-wide \"coronabonds,\" basically a pooling of debt among EU member states. One German commentator, Christoph Schiltz, urged German Chancellor Angela Merkel to reject the idea, writing in Die Welt newspaper that \"the mafia is just waiting for a new shower of money from Brussels.\"<br /><br />Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio described Schiltz` comments as \"shameful and unacceptable.\"<br /><br />Saviano said: \"European funds today help the Italian economy that is on its knees. And an Italian economy on its knees means Italy is at the mercy of organised crime.\"<br /><br />It`s not just Italy`s problem. The Mafia`s tentacles spread across Europe and far beyond. The `Ndrangheta has a Europe-wide network for distributing drugs, often using pizza restaurants as fronts. It has also invested in property.<br /><br />For now, reinforced border controls and nationwide lockdowns are choking distribution networks for drugs. But like the coronavirus, the mafia groups are no respecter of borders. \"The Mafia is very powerful also in Germany,\" said Roberto Saviano. \"They shoot less, but they are very powerful.\"<br /><br />Earlier this month, Pope Francis prayed for \"people who during this time of the pandemic, trade at the expense of the needy and profit from the needs of others, like the Mafia, usurers and others.\"<br /><br />\"May the Lord touch their hearts and convert them,\" the Pope said.<br /><br />History, as well as current evidence, suggests he may be disappointed.', 'Valentina Di Donato, Tim Lister', 'cnn'),

It`s also on life support', 'London (CNN) The makeshift poster is displayed proudly in the window of a London home. \"We love the NHS\" is written in children`s handwriting above a picture of a rainbow. A few doors down the street, another colorful arch is daubed on a bed sheet hanging from a balcony.<br /><br />It`s a common sight in the UK these days. Britons have been publicly declaring their love and support for the National Health Service , or NHS, by adorning their windows with pictures of rainbows. At 8 p.m. every Thursday for the past four weeks, they`ve opened their windows to clap and bang on pots and pans , to express their gratitude for the health workers fighting the country`s coronavirus battle<br /><br />The Covid-19 pandemic has brought the cherished national institution known by its three-letter acronym even further to the center of British life. Chronically underfunded and stretched to its limits even during normal times, the health service has never been under so much pressure. It has also never received more praise, love and gratitude from the public.<br /><br />But that support is nothing new. In public opinion surveys, people over and over again identify the NHS as the one thing that makes them most proud to be British, well above the royal family . When London hosted the Olympic Games in 2012, the opening ceremony featured an entire musical number honoring the NHS and its staff, with nurses dancing around children in hospital beds.<br /><br />\"There is this huge level of deep-rooted affection for the institution and pride in it and what we`re seeing now is that affection being manifested,\" Dan Wellings, senior fellow at the King`s Fund, a healthcare think tank, told CNN.<br /><br />It`s hard to pinpoint an exact reason for this affection. \"It`s not in data or numbers and evidence, it`s feelings and emotions and all the things that people can`t explain very well,\" said Laura Duffell‏, a matron at King`s College Hospital London. Duffell‏ works for the NHS and said she \"wouldn`t work anywhere else.\"<br /><br />\"It feels like you`re part of a family in all the different hospitals and all the different teams that I`ve worked in, the team spirit is always there.\"<br /><br />The government is tapping into those feelings to reinforce its strict social distancing measures. That messaging is clear: Stay at Home, Protect the NHS, Save Lives. The slogan is on every information leaflet the government has printed. It`s even on the lectern from which the country`s top officials -- standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson who is himself recovering from Covid-19 -- deliver their daily updates.<br /><br />The NHS is not unique. Many other European countries have publicly funded health systems that provide free medical care for everyone. But none can claim the NHS`s level of appreciation.<br /><br />\"The NHS is seen as something that we all have in common, something that we need never question, something we don`t need to plan for,\" said Cal Flyn, an author and journalist. Flyn collaborated with The Wellcome Collection, a museum and library dedicated to health, on a major project marking the NHS`s 70th anniversary in 2018 . \"The fact that we don`t need to pay for health insurance, and yet it is always there for us, especially at our lowest moments, makes it very morally unquestionable. It is seen as a force of pure good,\" Flyn added.<br /><br />The origin story<br /><br />The NHS was founded in 1948 as part of a huge national rebuilding effort following World War II. Since then, it has become an integral part of British society and the country`s biggest employer.<br /><br />It`s partly its origin story that makes the NHS so important to many.<br /><br />\"There`s a sort of folk memory of it ... people wanted a really big change and the NHS was part of it,\" John Appleby, the director of research and chief economist at the health think tank the Nuffield Trust, told CNN.<br /><br />Wellings added that the sense of post-war collectivism is still a big part of how people view the NHS. \"There are some values that are attached to it which play very strongly to a sense of Britishness: fairness, available to all, it`s equal, it`s primarily funded through taxation and it`s free at the point of need.\" The branding is great too. \"It`s so clear. The fact that it says `national,`\" Wellings said.<br /><br />The NHS, everyone agrees, is part of Britain`s national psyche.<br /><br />\"Stay home, protect the NHS, save lives\" has become the central coronavirus message in the UK.<br /><br />The key principle of the service is simple: medical care should be free for everyone. Whether it`s a routine check, chemotherapy or a hospital birth, patients do not need to worry about pulling out their credit cards when getting treated. A few parts, including dentistry, optical care and pharmacy have been privatized over the years, but the bulk of the service is public. Prescription drugs are free, but most people need to pay an prescription charge of £9.15 ($11.45).<br /><br />\"Virtually everybody contributes to the NHS in some way, there is no special NHS tax, it is not just funded out of income tax, it is funded out of all taxes, so everybody is putting in something, and the deal is, no matter who you are, whether you`re the Queen or me, there`s equal access to the things you need when you need them, and it`s decided not on your income but on your healthcare needs,\" Appleby said.<br /><br />Funding issues<br /><br />After the 2008 financial crash, the government`s tax revenues have suffered, and so did NHS funding. Health think tanks such as the King`s Fund say the NHS is now particularly vulnerable, as under previous Conservative governments, its funding did not match the increasing demand for healthcare. That led to longer waiting times, reduced availability and staffing shortages, according to research by the think tank.<br /><br />Attempts at injecting private investment brought short-term gain for long-term pain. One scheme used by Tony`s Blair Labour government to fund big NHS projects using private money cost a fortune: according to Nuffield Trust, by 2049, the NHS will end up repaying £82 billion for just £13 billion worth of such projects.<br /><br />Many Brits are acutely aware of the pressures the NHS is facing. When the call came for volunteers to help with the current crisis, nearly 1 million people signed up. There`s also been a huge spike in donations to charities that support the NHS and its staff.<br /><br />But not everyone is comfortable with the idea that the NHS should rely on charity. \"The response to these fundraisers is a little bit split, depending on one`s politics ... if you`re more left wing, you feel there should be no question that this money should come from central government ... at the same time, people want to help, and they want to treasure the service and to keep it running, especially in a time of crisis,\" Flyn said.<br /><br />In the UK, the NHS seems sacred and the resistance to overhauling it in a major way cuts across the British society -- most people said they would pay more tax if the NHS needed it, according to the surveys.<br /><br />\"People would not put up with politicians messing around with the very basics of the NHS,\" Appleby said. The promise that Brexit would mean more cash for the NHS was one of the decisive factors in the UK`s referendum on European Union membership in 2016, even as many economists warned that leaving the EU would likely hurt the UK economy and put NHS funding under pressure.<br /><br />As the grim reports of death and suffering keep coming in, day in day out, many in the UK are looking to the future, hoping the crisis will bring change to the way the NHS and its staff are treated.<br /><br />\"But perhaps on the other side of the coronavirus it will give them, their unions and so on enough ammunition to campaign for more money. I think there would be a lot of public support for that,\" Flyn said.<br /><br />Duffell, who is active in the RCN, the nursing union, is less optimistic. \"I would love to see the government investing in the National Health Service to the extent it should, but I just don`t think it`s going to happen, I don`t see it changing which is a big big shame.\"', 'Ivana Kottasová', 'cnn'),
(8, 'Police investigation into Italian care homes finds coronavirus violations', '(CNN) Italian authorities are looking into a string of health violations at elderly care homes across the country, amid a devastating coronavirus crisis .<br /><br />These violations included a lack of protective equipment for staff, and an absence of dedicated quarantine space to isolate suspected coronavirus patients, NAS said.<br /><br />Fifteen facilities have been closed and their patients relocated, NAS told CNN. Sixty-one people have been referred to judicial authorities which, because of the nationwide lockdown that has closed courts, will investigate using best practices until the lockdown is lifted. Following that, a full judicial process will be carried out. Another 157 people linked to elder care facilities were fined, amounting to a total of more than $78,500 (72,000 euros).<br /><br />The NAS announcement came on Wednesday, as Pope Francis prayed for the elderly in nursing homes at his morning mass, which was live streamed from Rome.<br /><br />\"Pope Francis`s intention for Wednesday`s Mass was for the elderly, especially those who are isolated or in nursing homes,\" the Vatican press office said in a statement. \"Many of them, he said, are afraid of dying alone. But `they are our roots, our story, our history.`\"<br /><br />The elderly are more at risk for severe and fatal coronavirus infections, and have been particularly hard hit in Italy. But there is little public information on how the virus may spread through nursing homes and residential senior centers. Italy`s health authority does not count deaths in elder care homes as Covid-19 deaths -- even if patients are suspected to have died with the virus -- and testing for the virus on the deceased in care homes is not standard practice.<br /><br />The NAS`s focus on elder care homes in Italy follows the death of more than 60 residents at one facility and a criminal investigation into another: the Pio Albergo Trivulzio home in Milan, which is under scrutiny for \"more than 100 deaths,\" according to Milan`s Public Prosecutor Mauro Clerici.<br /><br />Authorities are looking at charges related to contributing to the spread of the virus and manslaughter in the Pio Albergo Tivulzio case, he said. \"The investigation is underway into what crimes may have been committed in accordance with existing legislation as applied to a pandemic,\" Clerici told CNN. No arrests have been made and no one has yet been charged in the case. Under Italian law, authorities have up to a year to press charges after the initial investigation is launched.<br /><br />The facility told CNN it would not comment on the ongoing investigation. \"The rules regarding masks were followed,\" a spokeswoman of Pio Albergo Trivulzio told CNN. She added that the number of deaths in the first quarter of 2020 were in line with those in the same period last year.<br /><br />Staffers wearing protective outfits walk at the Pio Albergo Trivulzio nursing home in Milan on Tuesday, April 7, 2020.<br /><br />Italian Carabinieri, Italy`s national military police, told CNN that it has also begun carrying out checks in elder care facilities to ensure that visitor access, the management of personal protective equipment, staff training and quarantine spaces are in accordance with a decree issued by Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte on stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus. The checks have already resulted in fines, and the complete closure of at least one facility.<br /><br />The umbrella group for Italian nursing homes (Associazione Nazionale Strutture Terza Eta) told CNN that it will work to provide additional training and support for all member care centers.<br /><br />Elderly care centers are \"biological time bombs,\" Raffaele Antonelli Incalzi, head of Italian geriatric society SIGG, said last week. That is partly due to the fact that overcrowded hospitals are moving elderly patients into unprepared care facilities in order to free up space for urgent treatments, he explained.<br /><br />\"Creating modules for Covid in care homes (RSA) means putting elderly residents at risk who are the weakest link in this pandemic,\" Incalzi said.', 'Barbie Latza Nadeau, Sharon Braithwaite, Hada Messia', 'cnn');

(9, 'What Trump could learn from Angela Merkel about dealing with coronavirus', 'Berlin (CNN) President Donald Trump shocked not just Americans but many around the world with his insistence this week that -- at least insofar as reopening his country`s coronavirus-wracked economy is concerned -- his \"authority is total.\"<br /><br />With apparent disregard for the US Constitution, which confers sweeping powers to state-level authorities, Trump cried \"mutiny\" after Democratic governors objected to his pronouncement. One such governor, New York`s Andrew Cuomo, whose state has borne the brunt of the Covid-19 outbreak in the US, said the President was \"clearly spoiling for a fight on this issue.\" The President later backed down, in part at least.<br /><br />But as Trump chafes at the constitutional order in the US, another similarly decentralized country more than 4,000 miles away is getting a markedly different lesson in leadership. \"Federalism is not there so people can push away responsibility,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel said early on in the pandemic. \"It is there so that everyone takes responsibility in their area.\"<br /><br />To be sure, Germans have questioned whether their system, which devolves significant responsibilities to state and local levels, was best-suited to dealing with a fast-moving, international crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. Many asked whether Merkel, 15 years in office and dealing with a mystery health issue that gave her bouts of the shivers at public events , was capable of leading the charge. Was she \"amtsmuede\" -- weary of office?<br /><br />But, so far at least, the German system has held its own, and Merkel has maintained her grip -- in typically understated fashion. In particular, her measured addresses to the nation have contrasted sharply with Trump`s raucous daily briefings, which have roiled stock markets and alarmed health experts.<br /><br />\"How many loved ones will we lose, how high will the price be,\" asked Merkel, in one of her most emotional addresses, on March 18. In an appeal for everyone to work together, she added: \"It is in our own hands to influence the outcome of this crisis. I am convinced that we will manage to act responsibly to save lives.\"<br /><br />Unified approach<br /><br />Merkel`s words helped unify Germany behind the government`s response. The governor of the powerful state of Baden-Wuerttemburg, Winfried Kretschmann of the Green Party, which is a rival of Merkel`s conservative CDU, drew a scathing comparison between Germany and the US: \"We can see in the United States that some governors are taking matters into their own hands when there is someone at the helm who at first denied all of these threats. Something like that is completely out of the question here, that is why we are well equipped for this crisis.\"<br /><br />It is too early to make final assessments, but Germany`s response is looked upon with envy around the world. While the country has a large number of confirmed COVID-19 cases, the death toll remains remarkably low and the health system remains robust.<br /><br />After a meeting with state leaders Wednesday, Merkel announced that the country was ready to start carefully scaling back its lockdown. Many shops will be allowed to reopen next week, and schools will gradually reopen beginning early next month, though other restrictions will remain in place.<br /><br />\"She`s a diplomatic leader,\" says Jan Techau, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund, noting her ability to generate consensus among the country`s strong state governors. \"She can actually take a step back, become almost invisible and become the power-broker in the system. This has been her approach for the last 15 years, and it is especially useful in these kinds of moments when you have a crisis where you have to bring these people together where so much is at stake.\"<br /><br />Governors shape Merkel`s plan<br /><br />Federalism is as entrenched in Germany as it is in the United States. The chancellor in Berlin cannot force the governors of the nation`s 16 states to enforce social distancing measures, temporarily close restaurants and cafes, or shut down schools and universities. But they have gone along with, and helped shape, the common approach which Merkel said would constantly be re-evaluated to ensure people`s freedoms are not unnecessarily impeded.<br /><br />\"We know that our policies can only be effective if we closely coordinated them between federal government and the states,\" Merkel said in the early stages of the response to the pandemic. The success of Germany`s approach to combating coronavirus would not have materialized if politicians on both state and federal levels had not set aside their differences.<br /><br />Just like the United States, Germany is in the run up to a landmark election. In 2021, possibly even earlier, the country will elect Merkel`s successor . Germany`s health minister and two of the most powerful state governors are viewed as favorites to win the job. But all of them have agreed to focus on the coronavirus crisis and halt any sort of political showboating.<br /><br />The head of Germany`s largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, Armin Laschet, says Germany`s strong and unified reaction to the pandemic and the barrage of measures adopted across the country show that \"federalism is capable of acting.\"<br /><br />Merkel has been rewarded for the Germany`s strong and efficient response. Her approval ratings have increased dramatically and she is currently the most popular politician in the country. But Merkel hasn`t been bragging. Techau, of the German Marshall Fund, believes success in a decentralized, federal system comes down to exactly that: Less talk, more leadership.<br /><br />\"There must be somebody who is the national face of the crisis response. That`s what a chancellor that`s what a president are there for. And you have to play that role. And you best play it by acknowledging that you are not the master, who`s in charge of everything, but who, you know, needs to personify the unified responds with the country.\"', 'Analysis Frederik Pleitgen', 'cnn'),

Boris Johnson`s Conservative government is facing serious criticism over its handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.<br /><br />The move also comes as trust between the main opposition Labour Party and the Conservatives is particularly low, following four years of bitter divisions over Brexit.<br /><br />The proposals will allow MPs to grill ministers on the government`s coronavirus response as the UK enters what most experts agree will be its peak of the crisis, but Parliament will still be far from operating as usual. While it will still be possible for votes (known in the UK as \"divisions\") to take place in the House of Commons -- the means by which legislation receives Parliamentary approval -- these will still be restricted to members sat in the chamber itself.<br /><br />In a letter to MPs, Hoyle said \"I am aware of interest among colleagues in the possibility of using technology to allow Members to participate in divisions without being present on the Estate,\" adding that he had asked parliamentary staff \"to undertake preparatory work as a matter of urgency on a system of remote voting in divisions of the House.\"<br /><br />JUST WATCHED Tiny Louisiana parish has highest Covid-19 death rate in US Replay More Videos ...

This should be delivered as quickly as technologically possible.\"<br /><br />Votes are not the only problem that a physical absence poses to Parliament. Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Select Committee, says \"the major issue with not being in Parliament is that a lot of our work is done by bumping into each other and working out small problems informally.\"<br /><br />The move to a virtual parliament in Westminster comes at a time of wider uncertainty about Parliament`s future. The building is in desperate need of repair and modernizing.

This varies from agreeing to smaller gatherings of lawmakers in Ireland and Germany to physically distancing despatch boxes in Australia so that politicians can observe social distancing.<br /><br />However, Westminster is both larger than many of these bodies and more divided. Unlike many European nations, British politicians are not historically good at working across party lines at the highest level, meaning agreements will be harder to reach.<br /><br />Parliament will return on Monday, where the leader of the House of Commons, Jacob Rees-Mogg, will lay down the government`s business for the day.

He reported that a number of delicate tasks still needed to be completed in order to fully ascertain the structure`s condition, including accessing ceiling vaults for inspection and removing the scaffolding that had been erected before the blaze and had partially melted. Georgelin also said that large amounts of lead dust at the site posed a contamination risk that he was taking \"very seriously.\"<br /><br />Notre Dame cathedral where work on the rebuild has been on hold since March 16 due to the coronavirus shutdown.

It means brushing up on flight-deck skills and ensuring they keep within the boundaries of aviation`s stringent safety regulations.<br /><br />And that is presenting a looming challenge as pilots remain housebound.<br /><br />\"Pilots require frequent training and `recency` to be able to fly,\" says Brian Strutton of the British Airline Pilots Association, or BALPA, which represents the interests of all UK pilots.<br /><br />\"Recency\" means complying with regulations that stipulate a pilot must have successfully carried out three takeoffs and landings -- one of which using the cockpit`s autoland facility -- within the previous 90 days.<br /><br />Related content If you must fly, here are some tips to do it safely<br /><br />To qualify for flying both at daytime and night-time, commercial pilots also need to perform three night-time take-offs and landings within the 90 days, which are harder because the pilot has less visual cues. This covers the three daytime take-offs and landings as well.<br /><br />But there are other annual checks, as well.<br /><br />These include the License Proficiency Check, which a pilot would have to do every year to keep their pilot`s license valid. Also, the airline that the pilot flies for will have to perform an Operational Proficiency Check every six months.<br /><br />Airlines around the world have been forced to park their planes due to the coronavirus pandemic. Jeff Swensen/Getty Images North America/Getty Images<br /><br />\"Most of these checks could be conducted in what is known as a `D level` simulator,\" says Adam Twidell, an experienced pilot and CEO of PrivateFly, a booking platform for on-demand jets.<br /><br />These are the most realistic and offer the highest definition and lifelike responses -- just like flying the real thing.<br /><br />Simulators are also important to help pilots keep their skills sharp. While much can be practiced using computer games such as Microsoft Flight Simulator , there is no substitute when it comes to ratings, training and certifications. Pilots need to access real, full-scale flight simulators.<br /><br />But for that to happen, simulators need to be available. In the UK, for example, many facilities offering simulators are closed.<br /><br />There is also the issue of the availability of instructors and examiners to conduct checks. A co-pilot also needs to be present.<br /><br />\"There`s going to be a significant backlog of available simulator slots. When airlines do want to get back to normal operations they won`t be able to do it instantly,\" Twidell tells CNN Travel.<br /><br />Expense is an issue, too. Simulator time costs around $300 to $400 an hour, and that`s without the necessary associated personnel. It`s all an enormous undertaking.<br /><br />Air France pilots sit inside an Airbus A350 flight simulator at the company training centre near Roissy Charles de Gaulle airport. ERIC PIERMONT/AFP/AFP via Getty Images<br /><br />Additionally, there are regular fire and smoke training requirements, where pilots have to go into a smoke-filled aircraft and evacuate it. There are also first aid courses and crew resource management training, which involves assessing how crew members work together as a team.<br /><br />Combine the complexity of the different types of training and certifications that flight crew might have to catch up on if the grounding persists for a prolonged period with the fact that the majority of the world`s 290,000-plus active pilots are sitting at home, and the scale of the imminent problem becomes all too apparent.<br /><br />Pushing the boundaries<br /><br />To help alleviate the pressure accumulating from the potential expiration of the pilots` medical certificates and ratings (additional elements of the pilot`s license that allows them to fly specific types of aircraft), time extensions are being granted worldwide by regulatory authorities.<br /><br />Across Europe, the EU Aviation Safety Agency, or EASA, has extended the deadlines for certain requirements on condition that each airline comes up with a detailed pilot training plan that the agency will assess.

However, Sprules also says that a small minority of aviation businesses are taking an optimistic approach, believing that recovery will be sooner rather than later.<br /><br />\"What they want to do is keep their recruitment moving to capitalize on the fact that there are a lot of skilled crew in the market right now.\"<br /><br />Face-to-face interviews are now replaced with online tools such as Microsoft Office Teams or Skype. Airlines can build up pools of candidates so that as soon as the sector is back into recovery mode and restrictions start to subside they can jump into action.<br /><br />\"We are doing that with a few of our clients -- conducting applicant gathering and documentation screening and getting candidates to a point where we can go no further, until things start to move again,\" says Sprules.<br /><br />\"You start forgetting things\"<br /><br />So besides using computer simulators, how can pilots stuck at home keep their cockpit skills honed?<br /><br />Karlene Petitt, a US-based Boeing 777 pilot and author of \"Normalization of Deviance: A Threat to Aviation Safety,\" tells CNN that pilots could use this time of grounding for educational improvement.<br /><br />She says that in an age where certain aspects of the flight deck are automated, pilots need to know, procedurally, how to set up the flight deck, which buttons to push and which checklists to read.<br /><br />\"You start forgetting things if you don`t use them,\" she says. \"And much of what we, as pilots, do is cognitive based. If you can keep that alive, then you`re not going to lose proficiency.<br /><br />\"It would be nice if the airlines made available online training tools that we had during initial training or during initial type rating, so we could go and maintain proficiency while at home, until we get back into the sky.\"<br /><br />Carriers could also have the ability to track and see which of their pilots are actually utilizing those tools, says Petitt, adding that even a home-made low-tech approach could be beneficial too:<br /><br />In the past, when Petitt was \"out of the cockpit\" for a couple of years in the days before online pilot training was an option, she made flashcards and what she calls a \"paper trainer,\" a sort of wall poster, to practice cockpit procedures at home.<br /><br />\"We did this years ago.

Make It Nice<br /><br />On Wednesday night, in an Instagram posted on his personal page, Daniel Humm, chef and owner of Make it Nice hospitality group, announced plans to turn the lights back on and help NYC weather a storm he thinks is just beginning.<br /><br />\"Starting today, we have turned Eleven Madison Park into a commissary kitchen with the goal of producing thousands of meals per day for those who are working in the front lines and those who are deeply effected by the current crisis,\" Humm wrote on his Instagram featuring a dark, empty kitchen.<br /><br />The pandemic sweeping the world has been an especially dark time for high-end restaurants, many of which quickly pivoted to take out and delivery — alcoholic beverages to-go included — keeping a bare-bones staff and trying to stay afloat.<br /><br />Not all Michelin-starred restaurants attempted the shift. And, indeed, a restaurant such as Eleven Madison Park, where the price of dinner includes otherworldly hospitality and just the right amount of guest coddling, might have struggled to make a smooth transition to takeout.<br /><br />The economic consequences that posh restaurants have to contend with because of their standstill status are dire, says Hillary Dixler Canavan, the restaurant editor for the global food site Eater.<br /><br />Eleven Madison Park has partnered with a local nonprofit to serve food to first responders. Jake Chessum<br /><br />\"The high-end restaurants that are closed are bleeding cash right now,\" she says. \"In the US, they haven`t gotten economic relief from the government yet, and while some may get cash reprieve by pivoting to a takeout model, broadly speaking, to-go food at upscale restaurants isn`t profitable unless you do high volumes. These places weren`t designed for pick-up and delivery.\"<br /><br />As some mid-range restaurants struggle to serve customers during this uncertain period and as more upscale dining destinations opting for an all-out closure, dates of reopening TBD, Eleven Madison Park`s shift is noteworthy.<br /><br />To bring the commissary kitchen to fruition, the restaurant has partnered with Rethink Food NYC , a non-profit that upcycles excess food to distribute meals to underserved communities in NYC. American Express is also a partner.<br /><br />At this time, NYC`s underserved communities includes the men and women on the front lines of the pandemic and individuals who`d typically rely on food banks, many of which have closed due to health concerns around Covid-19.

(20, '`Together at Home` illustrates TV`s power to connect us, as rare as that is these days', '(CNN) The celebrity response to the coronavirus has generally followed the script of other tragedies. Fundraising concerts, rallying a sense of global connection and patriotism, and seeking to provide rays of uplift and hope.<br /><br />The setting and current circumstances, however, have altered that dynamic, in what has turned out to be a deeply personal way.<br /><br />On Saturday, the major networks teamed up for Global Citizen`s \"One World: Together at Home,\" an event support the fight against Covid-19 and the World Health Organization. Ratings aren`t available yet, but the organizers reported that the special generated nearly $128 million in pledged donations.<br /><br />On Thursday, more than 10 million people tuned in for \"The Disney Family Singalong,\" an ABC special in which various stars -- Beyoncé, Ariana Grande and Demi Lovato among them -- belted out songs from the Disney classics. If the special could be seen in part as a shrewd means of reminding people that you can find all those movies on Disney+, the studio`s streaming service, it nevertheless offered a warming note of reassurance at an unsettled time.<br /><br />The Global Citizen event brought to mind \"America: A Tribute to Heroes,\" a special jointly presented by the networks after the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Conceived by George Clooney, that program featured not only a star-studded assortment of musical performances but major celebrities manning the phone banks, a symbol that -- at the risk of quoting a song featured in the Disney special -- we`re all in this together.<br /><br />\"Together at Home\" also contained echoes of Band Aid, Live Aid and \"We Are the World\" -- a song that has experienced a timely resurgence -- the music industry`s collective response in the 1980s to African famine relief, bringing together a who`s who of musical acts.<br /><br />What`s different about the latest TV efforts is that they originate from the various performers` homes, a symbol of shared experience as well as the broad swath of fear that the pandemic has already inflicted and the potential extent of its reach.<br /><br />After all, one of the early names connected with the virus included Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson , a celebrity couple that -- in a sign of the times -- likely made the threat seem real to many at that moment in a way that early statistics on newscasts didn`t.<br /><br />Such heightened intimacy has already been evident as TV pivots into at-home mode, including late night talk shows that are now broadcast from the hosts` homes. The celebrity chat -- usually designed to promote movies or TV shows -- has given way to more sober conversations, while inviting family members ( including pets ) into the mix.<br /><br />These specials have come at a moment when people are huddled inside their homes, deprived of many of their usual pastimes. Television has always helped people process and deal with tragedy and uncertainty, but seldom with quite so captive an audience.<br /><br />At the same time, the communal feeling associated with \"A Tribute to Heroes\" in Sept. 11`s wake isn`t completely analogous to the climate now. The rally-around-the-flag effect has been blunted, for starters, by intense political polarization and questions about the Trump administration`s response to Covid-19.<br /><br />The age of social media has also fed hostility toward celebrities who don`t share one`s political views, even as people retweet those who agree with them. Finding points of commonality -- even during a crisis -- has become a more formidable challenge in these tribal times.<br /><br />Even so, the current shelter-at-home scenario has temporarily thrown TV back in time a few years. Network ratings are notably up, despite the advent of streaming services and seemingly ubiquitous tide of content.<br /><br />The sense of togetherness, clearly, has its limits. Content consumption is increasingly a niche-oriented proposition, as people scatter not only to different rooms but their own individual devices to watch entertainment and hear information that speaks narrowly to them.<br /><br />What we`ve seen in the last few days, with the Disney and \"Together at Home\" specials, is that there`s still a craving for the feeling of connectedness, of togetherness, that broadcasting has traditionally been uniquely able to provide. It`s just that such harmony is less indicative of what is, in normal times, than what was.', 'Analysis Brian Lowry', 'cnn'),

They are dedicated to it,\" said Dr Mosharraf Hossain, the key organiser of the noble move in the district.<br /><br />Mosharraf, the general secretary of Bangladesh Medical Association in Bagerhat, said the Covid-19 situation in the district is still not as bad as other parts of the country, but they pre-emptively made the move to organise those willing to serve people amid the crisis.<br /><br />He started with a call to action on his Facebook page for volunteers. Initially, the 100 people -- including medical college students, businessmen, political activists, and other general people from the district -- responded to his call.<br /><br />They will not provide any treatment but will assist Covid-19 patients in their daily lives, Mosharraf said.<br /><br />For example, the volunteers will manage vehicles so that Covid-19 patients in isolation can go to hospitals. They will cook food or arrange supplies whenever some or all members of a family are infected and need the support.<br /><br />The volunteers will help people in buying medicine and other necessities if their buildings are placed under lockdown. Patients will bear the cost, but the volunteers will make all arrangements, the organiser said.<br /><br />The move in the district praised by many, especially after the case of a 50-year old mother who was left in a forest in Gazipur by her sons on April 13, as they suspected her to be a Covid-19 patient.<br /><br />She was later rescued by local administration.<br /><br />Some Covid-19 patients are reportedly being driven out from their residence and some were asked to leave by their landlords and neighbours.<br /><br />Police warned of action against people partaking in these inhuman acts.<br /><br />\"I am saddened by the news of mistreatment of Covid-19 patients by their family members, neighbours, and house owners.

(7, 'Young Professionals at Risk', 'Leaving plans and to-do lists on the back burner, uncertainty has taken over the rest of our unmarked days on the calendar. While for many of us it seems like a temporary break from our stream of daily activities, this disruption comes with a high cost to young professionals. Be it the financial hurdles they are having to face right now or the many challenges that await them due to lost time, the youth of Bangladesh is having to prepare for the unknown.<br /><br />We spoke to a few young professionals about their experiences to better understand the situation they have been dealing with.<br /><br />Tutors and Part-time Employees<br /><br />Tutoring is one of the most accessible methods for young people to earn some quick money, especially for students. While commonly perceived as a method of earning a little something extra on the side, it is for some, a way to make livelihoods for oneself and their families. However, with the current shutdown, duties for a tutor have become difficult to deal with.<br /><br />Abdullah Al Mamun, a third-year Computer Science student of the University of Dhaka lives with his family in the capital`s Lalbagh area. His tutoring and his brother`s low-paying job are the main sources of income for the family. Under the current shutdown, he has had to dig into his savings to pay for living expenses this month, giving rise to anxiety about his family`s expenses for the coming months.<br /><br />Not only are the tutors struggling with income for the future, many are yet to receive payment for the previous months which could have helped suffice. Hafsa Rashid, a second-year student of North South University and tutor of over three years says, \"Due to the current situation, I tried to adapt according to the needs and hence started taking online classes. Sadly, attendance was significantly lower as parents commented they `did not believe` in online classes even though I had prepared extra notes and materials for the students. I put in more effort in my lectures but have had to deal with parents asking to pay less or none at all for virtual classes since `it isn`t the same`.<br /><br />She adds, \"My income has dropped significantly which would have otherwise helped my family. Unsure of how we may make ends meet in the coming months, I am having to consider dropping a semester as we`re already being asked to pre-advise for the next semester`s courses.\"<br /><br />Apart from tuition opportunities, young people also involve themselves in multiple other part-time jobs. One such individual, Sabreen Alim, barista at a popular cafe in Dhaka, says, \"Since we all aren`t able to work home due to the nature of the job, we`ve had to take leave without pay. Some of the senior baristas are still going to work to run the basic activities but as my family lives in Chittagong, I had to come back home and ask for leave earlier than the others.\"<br /><br />Fresh Graduates and Interns<br /><br />For those who have just graduated or about to graduate in the near future, the next few months are extremely important. With uncertainty being the only common denominator, all previous plans seem futile and new ones, unapproachable.<br /><br />\"This was the time for us to explore our opportunities and establish ourselves professionally. Though I was fortunate enough to get recruited by a private company just a week before the shutdown was announced, I had to start working from home even before I got the opportunity to get accustomed to the office environment and understand how things work,\" says Nikita Riffat, a recent graduate of engineering from North South University.<br /><br />Not only are the experiences and adjustment being impacted, but some are also struggling to find jobs altogether. Mushfiqur Rahman*, intern at a digital marketing agency, says, \"This internship is the last credit requirement, after which I will be done with my undergraduate degree. According to previous plans, I was to apply for jobs in the tenth week of my internship, or at least start a conversation in my current workplace about a new, permanent role. Instead it has all gone into a tailspin at the moment.\"<br /><br />When asked about the impact it has had on his internship experience, he says, \"Since timetables don`t always align, the creative process has not been the same as it was when everyone would get together and collaborate. Even though most details have been ironed out by now, it took some time to get there. However, things are a little more structured in an office environment and the implementation of work from home takes up more time and throws off the work-life balance as there are no actual closing times and weekends. There`s also the aspect of reduced payment due to the pandemic. Internships barely pay and reducing that certainly makes a difference, however, since it is an academic internship, the experience is more valuable than the remuneration.\"<br /><br />Speaking about his learning experience as an intern at a bank, Tahsin Nawaz says, \"Although the workload has been reduced significantly over the last weeks, so has the number of customers and the size of the workforce. After all, internships are opportunities to learn skills in a real-life setting. So, handling customers and learning to work collaboratively is a huge part of it. This has not only limited my abilities to learn all the services provided by a bank, but has caused the work environment to change drastically.\"<br /><br />Entrepreneurs<br /><br />Start-ups and businesses require a lot of time to plan and strategise every aspect before they are launched. Each step until and even after the launch is absolutely crucial, but with a crisis that is ambiguous in nature, multiple steps may have to be skipped and losses have to be incurred according to the nature of the situation.<br /><br />Ekram Mohammad, CEO and Lead Programmer of an e-learning start-up was asked about the experiences they`ve had in the past few weeks. He responds, \"Due to the shutdown, the demand for online platforms had rocketed, so we had to rush and launch our website before it was ready. Remotely tech-educating teachers has been one of the biggest challenges and though we had already given demonstrations to a few teachers beforehand, due to the nature of the work, many teachers approaching us were not able to successfully transition their classrooms.<br /><br />\"At one point, we noticed that most teachers were comfortable using phone applications, as they are more user-friendly. So then, we had to quickly reallocate our resources to release a mobile phone app variant at the earliest,\" he adds.<br /><br />Furthermore, many start-up businesses are incurring major losses due to the unpredictability of future events. Nahian Ibnat Beg, co-owns an event management firm which officially launched last year. About the challenges her firm is having to face, she mentions, \"Until the end of February, things were still close to normal. We had received multiple bookings for events and the respective advance fees as well which we had used to buy material and placed orders for resources. Shortly after, we had to return all of the advances, even the ones we had already spent by exhausting our existing reserve. We had also just recently started receiving organic exposure but that has also stopped. Now we have no upcoming work and savings.\"<br /><br />Things are drastically changing by the day and people from all fields are having to adjust their activities and work patterns, if they even have the opportunity to be working from home. To help make better sense of current situations, we spoke to Pro-Vice Chancellor (Designate) of Northern University Bangladesh, Prof. Dr. Engr. Md. Humaun Kabir about the current challenges and the prospective impacts.<br /><br />\"The most prominent challenge faced by young people during this situation would be the frustration that would inevitably arise. But, these young minds need to be able to deal with the situation positively and learn how to work unitedly. They must remain goal oriented and patient in order to be able to mitigate the impacts. I believe being optimistic is absolutely essential. New jobs will be created and the young generation will have new scopes for jobs. Hopefully our economy will be revived soon, but they must keep working hard,\" he says.<br /><br />The Covid-19 crisis has not only impacted career plans and work opportunities for the settled, but also incomes and livelihoods for young individuals and their families. Changes are taking place at an unprecedented rate and hence it can be tough to make sense of situations and plan accordingly. In a situation that is foreign to everyone, only time will tell how the young professionals can rise beyond such life-altering disruptions.<br /><br />*Name has been changed for privacy<br /><br />Syeda Afrin Tarannum would choose `The Script` over `G-Eazy` any day.

By quickly identifying those infected through exhaustive testing and aggressively tracking down their contacts to prevent further spread of the virus, the situation in Korea has been much stabilised.<br /><br />The number of newly confirmed cases per day has shown a sharp decline since hitting a peak at 909 on February 29. Recently, newly confirmed cases per day dropped to around 30, over 50 percent of which were infections from abroad. As of April 13, the cumulative number of Covid-19 patients in Korea recorded is 10,537, with 7,447 recovered and 217 deaths.<br /><br />We continue to remain vigilant as there are still sporadic infections in some parts of the country as well as confirmed cases coming from overseas.<br /><br />TDS: What is the secret to the success of effectively containing the spread of the virus?<br /><br />Hu Kang-il: Korea`s Covid-19 control strategy consists of robust testing to identify confirmed cases, tracing their contacts to prevent further spread, and treating those infected at the earliest possible stage, while actively engaging the public in participating in social distancing and other preventive measures.<br /><br />One of the innovative methods the Korean medical community adopted was \"Drive-through Testing Stations\". By allowing drivers to go through the testing process without having to leave their vehicles, we could reduce the time needed for sample collection to less than 10 minutes and also limit the exposure of frontline medical workers.<br /><br />Another method that a number of private hospitals in Korea adopted was a phone-booth type testing facility that enables \"walk-through\" of potential patients while protecting frontline medical workers who collect specimens behind clear acrylic panels. Incheon International Airport has introduced \"open-air walk-through\" testing stations that utilise the naturally windy outdoor environment for ventilation.<br /><br />TDS: How can South Korea extend its support to Bangladesh?<br /><br />Hu Kang-il: Since the outbreak of Covid-19, the governments of Bangladesh and Korea have been communicating closely with respect to their domestic situations, immigration and aviation policies, and possible measures to jointly tackle the challenge.<br /><br />While exerting every effort to curb the epidemic domestically, the Korean government is prudently reviewing the numerous requests from partner countries for test kits, PPEs, and financial support. We are actively sharing best practices and technical expertise with our partners, including Bangladesh, and at the same time seeking effective ways to help Bangladesh secure necessary medical equipment in this difficult time.<br /><br />TDS: What should the Bangladesh government be doing right now to contain the spread of Covid-19?<br /><br />Hu Kang-il: It is encouraging that the government of Bangladesh is making full use of available resources to tackle this formidable challenge. Honourable Prime Minister Hasina seems to be fully engaged in the nationwide fight against Covid-19, making frequent public announcements and directives.<br /><br />Particularly, I would like to highlight the importance of keeping up the number of testing, not only in the capital city but also in rural areas of the country. This will enable the government to see a more accurate picture of the situation and thereby enhance the effectiveness of tracking and treatment measures. Korea`s experience proves that rigorous testing is one of the most important components of a successful response.<br /><br />In the meantime, it is extremely important that everyone does their part to limit further spread of the virus by strictly adhering to government directives including social distancing, wearing masks, and frequent hand disinfection.<br /><br />TDS: How is this virus outbreak affecting Korean companies operating here?<br /><br />Hu Kang-il: Most Korean companies in Bangladesh, many of them in the RMG sector, have ceased operations in their factories in compliance with the Bangladeshi government`s directives to temporarily shut down all public and private offices. As is the case with the majority of local industries during this economic slump, these Korean companies face the risk of liquidity crunch as the government holiday is prolonged.<br /><br />In this regard, it is imperative the Korean companies be eligible for tax breaks and low-interest loans laid out in the government`s latest financial stimulus packages. Local and foreign companies alike must be kept afloat in this difficult time lest they be driven out of business to aggravate the economic downturn.<br /><br />TDS: What could be the economic impact of the virus outbreak and how can Korea join in helping Bangladesh recover?<br /><br />Hu Kang-il: The Covid-19 pandemic will negatively affect the global economy in a wide range of areas including export industries, domestic consumption, jobs and income, food security, and inequality.<br /><br />We do not yet know how long this global pandemic will last, but one thing is for sure. The sooner we defeat the virus, the sooner we will start seeing economic recovery. As a trusted partner, Korea will stand by Bangladesh during its fight against the disease and will continue to seek ways to provide assistance in a variety of areas.<br /><br />TDS: Do you have any special message for the Bangladeshi people on overcoming the crisis?<br /><br />Hu Kang-il: Korea has shown the world that it is possible to curb the spread of Covid-19 by setting priorities straight and allocating resources in the right places. The Bangladesh government too has responded swiftly with a nationwide shutdown and strict implementation, public health directives, and a series of aggressive stimulus plans. Therefore, I would like to advise the people of Bangladesh to count on their government and follow the directives in place in order to successfully overcome the crisis.', '', 'dailystar'),
